# Python Solar System Visualization

## Overview

This Python script provides a simple visualization of the solar system using the `matplotlib` library. The script generates a basic representation of the planets in our solar system. Explore this script to understand the fundamentals of visualizing the solar system in Python.

## Script Components

- **Library Usage:** Utilizing the `matplotlib` library for basic 2D visualization.
- **Solar System Data:** Incorporating basic data on the planets, such as size and distance from the sun.
- **Visualization Design:** Creating a simple plot to represent the solar system.
- **Color Coding:** Adding colors and labels to distinguish different planets.
- **Output Display:** Displaying the generated solar system visualization.

## Running the Script

1. Install the required library by running `pip install matplotlib` in your Python environment.
2. Open and run the Python script (`solar_system_visualization.py`) in a Python environment.
3. The script will generate a basic plot visualizing the solar system.

## Customization

- Modify the script to include additional details about each planet.
- Experiment with different color schemes or 3D visualizations for a more immersive experience.
- Adapt the code to include other celestial bodies or specific solar system events.
